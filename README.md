## Introduction

# my-sinatra-app

In the app above, we require the sinatra and json libraries. We also define a function search_movies that takes a query and returns an array of movie data.

# Function

We  define two routes: a root route that just displays a welcome message, and a /movies/search route that takes a query parameter and returns JSON data of movies that match the query.

# Running the app:

To run the app, we simply run ruby app.rb in the terminal, and then visit http://localhost:4567 in our browser to see the welcome message. 

To search for movies, visit http://localhost:4567/movies/search/<your-query> in your browser, replacing <your-query> with your actual search query.

# Conclusion:

The application can search for movies as long as the key word is properly inprinted.
